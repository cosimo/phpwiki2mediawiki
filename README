phpwiki2mediawiki
=================

= Introduction =

This tool can help you quickly convert a phpwiki page into a mediawiki page.
It's not a batch tool, but it can assist you build one.

== Requirements ==

It requires php5 to run.
Usually the =php5-cli= package is all you need.

  sudo aptitude install php5-cli

== How it works ==

It reads the phpwiki page content from STDIN, and outputs the content converted
to mediawiki format to STDOUT.

=== Example ===

  $ php5 ./phpwiki2mediawiki.php < Sample.phpwiki > Sample.mediawiki

No additional format checks are done.
If the format is not phpwiki, then you're basically screwed.
It helped me at least.

Good luck!

== Where does this come from? ==

It comes from another phpwiki-to-mediawiki conversion tool I've seen
on the Internetz, plus a few more bonus fixes thrown in.
